    "# Tutorial for loading leaderboard competition data\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with this competition, you will need to download the data for the two tasks, sleep cassette and motor imagery (MI). You could either handle them yourself, downloading them from here:\n",
    "- Sleep Source : https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/SleepSource/14839659\n",
    "- Sleep Leaderboard test data : https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/LeaderboardSleep/14839653\n",
    "- MI source 1 (Cho2017) : ftp://parrot.genomics.cn/gigadb/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100295/mat_data/\n",
    "- MI source 2 (BNCI 001-2014) : http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal is to detect sleep stage, using source sleep EEG age group 25-59 with training trials and labels, and apply this on target age group 60-80 (10 sessions). The target dataset, called Leaderboard Sleep, is divided in two groups. First group contains 5 example subjects with labels, they are the example subjects from the testing group. Second group is the testing group, which contains the leaderboard subjects 6-17 that without labels. You need to give predictions for those labels.\n",
